<h4>When STAR Collaborative successfully places you in a project, we will not drop by with treats.</h4>
<p>We are not going to give you STAR-themed swag like pens, notebooks or t-shirts.</p>
<p>We do not have a box suite for the Twins, the Wild, or the Vikings, so don’t wait for an invite.</p>
<p>It’s not that we don’t care or don’t want to hang with you — it’s just that we thought you’d rather get more money in your pocket from the bill rate on the project. Isn’t that a lot more exciting than a bunch of junk food or tchotchkes that will collect dust on your shelf?</p>
<p>STAR does not offer bloated overhead costs like fancy offices, multiple levels of management, or highly-compensated sales people. All of these things add up and take money out of your pocket.</p>
<p> We run a lean operation that ensures our clients get talent at market rates, while giving you, the consultant, the bulk of the bill rate. Our low and transparent markup ensures that you receive the best rate possible on consulting gigs through STAR — without all the unnecessary fluff in the system.</p>
<p><i>What do you want? Donuts or dollars?</i></p>
