			<h4>Donuts or dollars?</h4>
			<p>Just so we’re clear up front, if we successfully place you in a project at one of our clients, we’re not going to randomly drop in and bring you donuts. We are not going to give you STAR-themed swag like pens, notebooks or t-shirts. We do not offer bloated overhead costs like fancy offices, multiple levels of management, or highly-compensated sales people. All of these things add up and take money out of your pocket. Finally, we do not have a box suite for the Twins, Wild, or Vikings, so don’t look for a game invite from us. </p>
			<p>It’s not that we don’t care or want to hang with you, it’s just that we thought you’d rather get more
money in your pocket from the bill rate on the project, and isn’t that a lot more exciting than a bunch of junk food or chachkies that will collect dust on your shelf?</p>

    <p>No secrets. No surprises. We let you know the opportunity details, bill rate, and get your permission before submitting you for any role. </p>

			<h4>We know you can’t work with just one firm. We just want to be your favorite.</h4>
		<p>Like a magician who tells you how the trick is performed, STAR Collaborative’s transparent business model has exposed the staffing and consulting industry’s secrets. Here are a few examples of our transparency:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When we work with you on a potential contracting role, we tell you the client bill rate, and your pay rate, so you know exactly your share of the bill rate.</li>
			<li>If we think you’re a good match, we’ll get your permission to present your resume. We never submit a resume without your knowledge and approval.</li>
			<li>You get access to <strong> ALL</strong> of the opportunities we receive, which are instantly viewable on our website or delivered to you via email subscription.</li>
			<li>We’ll let you know if you’re a good fit for the role you are interested in, and if we think presenting you to the client is a good idea.</li>
			<li>We’ll give you honest and direct feedback, and we’ll help you maximize your resume to ensure marketability.</li>
			<li>As we work with our clients as they review and vet candidates, we’ll provide you with any feedback provided so we can adapt and improve.</li>
		</ul>

			<p>Even though we think these things are common sense, they’re not always common practice in the industry. Our goal is to create a positive candidate experience for you based on no secrets or surprises.</p>

			<h4>How many staffing firms can literally say they’ve been in your shoes?</h4>
			<p>It’s often said that you can’t understand a person unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. If that’s the case, we’ve walked more than a few marathons in understanding the challenges you face in your role!</p>
			<p>STAR’s owners, operations team, and candidate relations project managers have actually worked on your side of the table. We were the internal corporate team members responsible for sourcing, managing, and maintaining the quality of third party contractors and consultants. We’ve led massive, cross-functional program and project teams and had to assemble the right portfolio of talent to get the job done. We’ve led PMOs and internal vendor management and resource programs. Basically, we’ve been the candidate, client, hiring manager, vendor and resource manager (we are younger than it seems)!</p>
		  <p>Not only that, we know the operations, logistics, and procurement steps necessary to get talent sourced, screened, onboarded and running in an efficient and effective way. We know the internal demands to finding the right talent, and we do our best to make your job easier.</p>
		  <p>We are not a start up, we’ve been in business since 2009, serve more than 70 clients and have placed hundreds (soon to be 1000’s) of contract, contract-to-hire, and direct hire candidates at all size companies: small startup to Fortune 50 VMS programs. We can handle any size or volume talent needs, thanks to our unique knowledge of the business of doing business.</p>
