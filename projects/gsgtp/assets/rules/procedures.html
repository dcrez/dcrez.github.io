<h4>Contest Procedures</h4>
<ol type="A">
<li>Contestants must pull in the position drawn. In case of mechanical breakage, contestant may drop to last position. This will constitute the pullers first attempt to pull and therefore will only have one remaining attempt to compete.</li>
<li>Each driver has the right to have the sled spotted to a particular location on the starting line. </li>
<li>Each competitor will be allowed two attempts to make a measurable pull. An attempt is defined as moving the sled 1" or further. On first attempt, if the competitor lets off on the throttle before reaching the 75 ft. line, the competitor will get a second attempt, even if he/she went beyond the 75 ft. line. If no attempt is made to back off the throttle, no second attempt will be granted. Any disqualification on first attempt bars a second attempt.</li>
<li>On any re-pull caused by contest malfunction, the competitor may either re-hook immediately or drop to last.</li>
<li>If a class is restarted, the next puller in order will have test puller option; tractors that have pulled will drop to the end of the class.</li>
<li>If the last competitor in the class has difficulties, this puller will have 3 minutes to hook to the sled and make their first attempt to pull.</li>
<li>If a vehicle is legal when hooked to a sled and breakage occurs while under the green flag, the pull will be measured.</li>
<li>All vehicles must be in neutral/park while being hitched and unhitched to/from sled.</li>
<li>All pulls must start with a tight chain.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Test Puller</h4>
<ol type="A">
<li>The competitor pulling in first position of each class, as determined by draw at time of entry is considered the test puller.</li>
<li>Provided that the weight transfer is deemed right, the test puller may:
<ul>
<li>accept their distance or</li>
<li>refuse their distance and drop to last in the class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is the competitor's responsibility to inform the finish flagman as to his/her decision to take or drop the test pull. Leaving the track without informing the official(s) of his/her decision, forces the assumption that the test puller wishes to accept their distance.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Pull-Off</h4>
<ol type="A">
<li>A "floating finish line" will be used.
</ol>
</li>

<h4>Inclement Weather</h4>

<li>Purse money will be paid to those classes that are completed according to the results for those who have hooked.</li>
<li>In any class in which all entered competitors do not get an official chance to compete, all competitors entered in that class, with the competition vehicle on grounds and ready to compete, will receive 10 hook points.</li>
