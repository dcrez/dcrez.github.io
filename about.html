<h2 style="line-height:2em;">About Us</h2>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><span class="label label-primary" style="font-size:1.2em;">Club History</span></p>
<br>
<p>The Gopher State Garden Tractor Pullers Inc. is an organization which is comprised of people from all walks of life, both families and singles, from grade school age children to grandparents.  We are involved in this fun sport for the pleasure of fair competition, promoting sportsmanship, and to demonstrate our mechanical and driving talents while providing entertainment for spectators.</p> 
<p>Our club originated in the small southern Minnesota community of Spring Valley.  The original organization was sponsored by the local high school Future Farmers of America, which in those days used tractors that were strictly stock lawn tractors.  The competition came from one puller bragging that his tractor could out pull everyone else's.</p>
<p>To put an end to this boasting, the tractors were hooked to a flat sled weighted by volunteers.  Each person jumped on as the sled was pulled down the track to increase the weight, which required more traction to move the sled.  Thus a winner was determined by the tractor that could pull the most weight the farthest.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><span class="label label-primary" style="font-size:1.2em;">Present Organization</span></p>
<br>
<p>The Gopher State Garden Tractor Pullers have been incorporated since 1984.  We are a non-profit organization, which operates on club membership dues, class entry fees and the fee charged for providing entertainment.  </p>
<p>There are many expenses incurred to produce our show, including: 
<ul>
<li>insurance,</li>
<li>eliminator (sled) rental, </li>
<li>scale maintenance, </li>
<li>P.A. system and radio systems</li>
<li>and club operating expenses.</li>
</ul>  
<p>The club makes a cash payback to the top finishers in each modified class and trophies to the first place and cash to the other top finisher in the off the lawn classes.  Points are also awarded to the tractors in order of finish to determine the top tractors in each modified class, which get recognized at our annual awards banquet.</p>
<p>The responsibility of orchestrating each event rests with our board of directors, which are elected at the annual meeting by the club members for a three-year term.  The president of the board is also elected annually by the club members.  Our club is governed by the by-laws, which were established when the club was founded, and are periodically updated by a two-thirds majority vote of the club members.</p>

<div class="col-md-4">
<p><span class="label label-primary" style="font-size:1.2em;">Track Operations</span></p>
<br>
<p>Gopher State Garden Tractor Pullers use a mechanically operated weight transfer device, referred to as the "Eliminator or Sled."  This device uses a drive mechanism to transfer the weight box forward as the Eliminator is pulled down the track.  As the weight moves forward, more force is applied to the pan sliding on the track, which creates resistance and eventually stops the tractor.  Each Eliminator is equipped with an electronic device to measure the distance of each pull.  Therefore eliminating the need for track workers to manually measure each pull attempt.
<p>The Eliminator and tractors both must pass strict safety inspections before they are permitted to participate at a GSGTP sanctioned event.  All moving parts must be properly shielded and engine kill switches operational.  All drivers are required to wear a safety helmet.  Some classes also require the driver to wear a fire suit.  All tractors and Eliminator are equipped with fire extinguishers.</p>
<p>A restricted pit area is preferred to protect spectators during tractor weigh in.  Each tractor must pass over the GSGTP digital electronic scale before entering competition.  The flagman controls the activity on the track at all times while the announcer uses the P.A. system to broadcast the pull distance and help keep the crowd entertained throughout the event.  A fence barrier must be erected at least 10 feet from the track as a boundary for safety of the spectators and club members.  Safety is our #1 priority.
