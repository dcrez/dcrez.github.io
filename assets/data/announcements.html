    <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Rules Updates</h4>
    
    <p class="list-group-item-text show-read-more">A series of updates have been made to the rules. These changes are:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Mini Rod</strong>: If your tractor is under 370 cubic inches, you can add 50lbs to your tractor.</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Altered through Mini Rod</strong>: must wear a full fire suit, jacket, and pants
    <ul>
    <li>We understand that this rule may cause hardship for some, but there are many pullers that have extra suits you can borrow.</li>
    <li>This is for the safety of our pullers, and the professionalism of our club.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fuel</strong>: Nitros is <i>not</i> allowed. This has been a known rule, but we changed the verbiage in the rule book in all classes to reflect it so there are no questioned as to what is allowed.</li>
    </ul>
