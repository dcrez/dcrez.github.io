      <li>One stabilizer bar shall be on each side of the tractor with the combination of the two strong enough to support the weight of the tractor when a jack is placed under them to raise the tractor when weighted to maximum weight for competition class with driver.</li>
      <li>Bumper bars must be incorporated into each independent stabilizer bar. Bumper bar must extend 6" vertical from the rear most tip of skid pad or back edge of wheel. The top of the vertical bar must be braced forward to stabilizer bar or chassis. Stabilizer/ bumper bar set must be at least 8" apart.

    <ol>
      <li>All vehicles must have a drawbar that is constructed from non-cast material and is stationary in all directions. Minimum drawbar thickness at hook point: 3/8", maximum 3/4". Point of hook minimum opening: 1 3/4" round hole, maximum 2" hole.</li>
      <li>Minimum 1/2" cross section thickness required around any opening machined or manufactured into drawbar assembly. Minimum diameter of any attaching round stock or pivot pin: 1/2". Minimum of 5-3/8", Grade #5 bolts or equivalent welding strength required to secure drawbar assembly to differential housing or chassis.</li>

          <li>Each grade is acceptable for use in GSGTP competition.</li>
          <li>Maximum specific gravity for GSGTP competition: .7928.</li>
